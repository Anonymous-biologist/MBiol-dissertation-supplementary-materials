  - Movement_analysis.Rmd - a R Markdown file containing the code for motility analysis
  - Autofluorescence_analysis.Rmd - a R Markdown file containing the code for autofluorescence analysis
  - Autofluoresence_quality_control.R - a R file containing the code for quality control of the autofluorescence data
  - Autofluorescence_quantification_reliability.Rmd - a R Markdown file containing the code for determining the reliability of the autofluorescence measurements
- Raw data files:
  - Lifespan.csv - the raw data used for the lifespan analysis
  - Movement.csv - the raw data used for the motility analysis
  - Green_autofluorescence.csv - the raw data used for the green autofluorescence analysis
  - Red_autofluorescence.csv - the raw data used for the red autofluorescence analysis
  - Green_reliability.csv - the raw data used for estimating the reliability of green autofluorescence measurements
  - Red_reliability.csv - the raw data used for estimating the reliability of red autofluorescence measurements
- Example images and videos:
  - Images directory - contains example images used for autofluorescence measurements (in both the green and in the red spectra) over the entire length of the experiments
  - Videos directory - contains example videos (of both young and old worms) used for quantifying motility
